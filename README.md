# Shoppinglist
App for creating,saving and sharing shoppinglists using .NET core MVC

Getting back to basics with .NET and C#, haven't touched those in a long time.

Basic functionalities are there: Register/login (no confirmation email system for ease of use), List functionalities (CRUD), Friend system for sharing your lists.
Might (or might not) add something to this at a later point, or start another project.
